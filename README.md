# MicroEMACS
This is an unofficial repository for the MicroEMACS Editor by Daniel Lawrence.

It started as a copy of Peter Chapman's repository
<https://github.com/pmachapman/memacs>. I've frozen the state at the
time of the fork in the *archive* branch.

Its purpose is to keep this wonderful editor usable and alive by doing
necessary source code maintenance (currently only for some Unix
operating systems, e.g. FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux and Solaris):
* Bug fixing,
* porting to current operating systems and
* some improvements.


## Change Log
[2021-08-05.00]
* It works on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris (tested with SunOS 5.7).
* Unified ifdefs for Unix Operating Systems.

[2021-07-14.00]
* Activated support for file locking.

[...] Added several bug-fixes that make the code compile and work on
modern Linux and FreeBSD systems.



For completeness I quote Peter Chapman's README.md here:
```
## Introduction
I have found it hard to track down the source code for MicroEMACS, 
and with Daniel's passing I have noticed that links from his home page are breaking.

This project seeks to collect the source code and binaries for MicroEMACS, and provide them all from one place

## Readme

Please refer to [DOC/README](doc/readme) for the complete MicroEMACS readme file.

## Copyright

This code retains the copyright Daniel placed on this work (refer to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)), and on his passing I assume it is now with his estate.

I will endeavour to respect this, and request that you do the same, until notified otherwise.
