# MicroEMACS
This is an unofficial repository for the MicroEMACS Editor by Daniel Lawrence.

## Introduction
I have found it hard to track down the source code for MicroEMACS, 
and with Daniel's passing I have noticed that links from his home page are breaking.

This project seeks to collect the source code and binaries for MicroEMACS, and provide them all from one place

## Readme

Please refer to [DOC/README](doc/readme) for the complete MicroEMACS readme file.

## Copyright

This code retains the copyright Daniel placed on this work (refer to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)), and on his passing I assume it is now with his estate.

I will endeavour to respect this, and request that you do the same, until notified otherwise.
