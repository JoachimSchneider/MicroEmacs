# MicroEMACS
This is an unofficial repository for the MicroEMACS Editor by Daniel Lawrence.

It was forked from Peter Chapman's repository
<https://github.com/pmachapman/memacs>. I've frozen the state at the
time of the fork in the *archive* branch.

I added are several bug-fixes that make the code compile and work on
modern Linux and FreeBSD systems.



For completeness I quote Peter Chapman's README.md here:
```
## Introduction
I have found it hard to track down the source code for MicroEMACS, 
and with Daniel's passing I have noticed that links from his home page are breaking.

This project seeks to collect the source code and binaries for MicroEMACS, and provide them all from one place

## Readme

Please refer to [DOC/README](doc/readme) for the complete MicroEMACS readme file.

## Copyright

This code retains the copyright Daniel placed on this work (refer to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)), and on his passing I assume it is now with his estate.

I will endeavour to respect this, and request that you do the same, until notified otherwise.
```
