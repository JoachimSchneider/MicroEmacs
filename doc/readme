	This is the offical release of version 3.12 of MicroEMACS.  This
file gives information on registering MicroEMACS, features which have
changed since version 3.11, notes on various installations, future
directions for MicroEMACS, contact information and bug reporting
procedures.

********** Registering MicroEMACS **********

	Keeping many environments up to date, fielding questions over
the phone, applying bug fixes and adding new features is reasonably
large task. I have been writing, maintaining and supporting MicroEMACS
since 1985. I have bought numerous computers solely to port and support
MicroEMACS on those platforms. I can not even begin to count the number
of people using MicroEMACS, and I have recieved support calls,
registrations and inquiries from many countries all over the globe. This
keeps me very busy for a hobby that I do outside my normal employment.
	If you like MicroEMACS, and want to see more work, new versions
and other shareware software to go along with it, show your support by
registering your copy. Send your registration of $25 US and I will place
you on the registration list. You will recieve information on new
releases and preferential support. If you have recieved MicroEMACS
through a software library, a CDROM collection, or a user's group, none
of those fees are passed along to the software author. Register with me
and get the latest versions, info and have a voice into future
directions.

********** Installation Notes **************

	MicroEMACS is supplied on two 3 1/2" inch diskettes in IBMPC
format. The first disk is an MSDOS, MicroSoft Windows and OS/2
installation disk. For any of these environments, insert the disk into
your A: drive, and type:

	a:install

	The installation program will lead you through installing
MicroEMACS and all of its related files on your system's hard drive.
After installation, these are the names of the various executables:

	EMACS.EXE	MSDOS real mode version (640K limit)
	EMACS16M.EXE	MSDOS protected mode version
			(will use all memory, slightly slower than real mode)
	MEWIN.EXE	MicroSoft Windows 3.1 version
	OS2EMACS.EXE	OS/2 1.3, 2.0 or 2.1 version

	The second disk is a ZIP archive of all the sources, documents,
command files and makefiles. Copy this file to an empty directory on
your hard drive, and then use any unZIPper and allow it to extract this
tree of files on your hard drive. Some of the resulting files and
subdirectories will include:

AIX          makefiles for AIX (a UNIX varient)
AMIGA        makefiles for the Commodore AMIGA
ATARI        makefiles for the Atari ST
CMD          standard .CMD command files
DGEN         makefiles for the Data General
DOC          documentation files (including this!)
FMR          makefiles for the Fujitsu FMR series MSDOS computers
H            .H header files
HP150        makefile for the HP150 MSDOS computer
HPUX         makefile for the HP9000 workstations
I55          makefile for the IBM 5550 Katakana computer
MPE          makefile for the HP3000 series computer
MSWIN        makefiles and auxillary files for MicroSoft Windows 3
NEC          makefiles for the NEC 9800 series MSDOS machines
NT           makefiles for Windows NT
OS2          makefiles for OS/2
PCDOS        makefiles for various IBM-PC compilers and versions
POSIX        makefiles for POSIX (a UNIX varient)
SRC          .C source files
SUN4         makefiles for SUN-OS 4.1 and above (not Solaris)
VMS          makefile for DEC's VMS operating system
WINHELP      source code for the windows help files
XENIX        makefiles for XENIX
CLROBJ.BAT   MSDOS batch file to clear out all the object and executable files
DE.BAT       MSDOS batch file to create a diff from an old version
TODO         pending development tasks
UTOD.CMD     emacs command file to fix line termination on file group

	Included on this disk is a public domain MSDOS unzipping program
called "unzip" written by a group of USENET programmers. Both the actual
executable and the self unpacking package with all of its documention is
provided. Copy the diskette to the target directory, and type:

	unzip ue312

	to extract all the sources, command files, makefiles and
documentation to their proper directories within the that directory.

	If you need to build a version from the source files, unpack
these files, and move them and all its subdirectories to the target
machine. Change to the directory most appropriate for the machine for
which you are building MicroEMACS. Edit ESTRUCT.H, changing the
definition from zero to one for the appropriate hardware, compiler,
terminal driver. Edit any other parameters or options as appropriate.
You may need to create an OBJ and a BIN subdirectory from this
directory. Then run your make utility to compile and link a MicroEMACS
executable.

	Under MicroSoft windows, use the NEW option of the FILES menu of
the file program manager to add a program item. Set the program
executable to the drive where you installed MicroEMACS, remembering the
name of the Windows executable is mewin.exe. The MicroEMACS icon will
appear in the program window you have currently open.

	Under OS/2, copy a program template to the desktop, and then use
its settings menu to set the path to the program executable and the
correct working directory. The name of the OS/2 executable is
OS2EMACS.EXE. The icon for MicroEMACS should replace the template icon.
Drag this to where you want it to be placed.

	Under the differing varieties of UNIX, if you are installing
MicroEMACS systemwide, you need to place it and all of its command files
into a directory that all your users can access. Rename the emacs.rc
startup file to .emacsrc. Once your users have this directory in their
path, they will be able to use MicroEMACS. They can create a local
.emacsrc file that will overide the code in the system MicroEMACS
startup file. Be carefull to allow read permissions on all the
MicroEMACS files.

	On the Atari ST, be sure that MicroEMACS is installed as a GEM
application from the GEM desktop.  If this is not done, MicroEMACS will
grow confused about the state of the mouse, and ring the bell alot to
alert the user to the problem.  (Mouse handling on the Atari is both
complex and triple layered....).

********** Major New Features since 3.11 *********

>>> Windows and Windows NT GUI versions

	Pierre Perret made an enormous effort and produced the code to
allow MicroEMACS to run under MicroSoft Windows and Windows NT as a GUI
style application. Its very good. Try it!

>>> MSDOS DMPI version!

	Under an agreement with Rational Systems, Inc, one version of
the distributed executable, "emacs16m.exe" is GLUed to their 16 bit DOS
extender product, which allows it to run as a protected mode program. If
you have a 386 or better and use this executable, you can use ALL
available extended memory to hold files to be edited. If you own this
product you can rebuild this version from the supplied sources and
makefiles.

>>> New MSDOS, Windows, OS/2 installation

	Using Knowledge Dynamics Corporations INSTALL 3.2 program, it is
easier than ever to install versions of MicroEMACS on to your computer.
Just put the disk in your A: drive and type "A:INSTALL".

>>> Highlighted Regions

	Using the mouse to cut and paste, the selected region is now
displayed in reverse video. This works under all environments supporting
both mice and reverse video.

>>> Support for AUX

	MicroEMACS now supports Apple's AUX UNIX-Like operating system.

>>> Displays time in bottom modeline

	if $timeflag is set to TRUE, the time of the last keystroke is
displayed in the bottom most modeline.

>>> Partial completion lists

	Attempting a file/buffer/command completion when there are more
than one remaining posibility will bring up a pop up buffer of possible
completions. Keep typing letters and attempt the completion again when
they are more unique.

>>> Kill Ring implimented

	New commands yank-pop (M-Y), delete-kill-ring (M-^Y), and
cycle-ring (^X-Y) impliment a ring of kill buffers.

>>> Current point position displayed

	If $posflag is set to TRUE, the position of the point in the
current window is displayed as a line and column value in that window's
modeline. This defaults to TRUE with the standard startup files.

>>> New function &rev

	This returns the characters of its argument in reverse order.

>>> Mouse support under OS/2

	The OS/2 version now fully supports all MicroEMACS mouse handling.

>>> Console style Windows NT support

	A very fast console style driver for MicroEMACS under MicroSoft's
Windows NT operating system is an alternative for the GUI driver.

>>> Buffer variables now terminate

	When using a buffer variable, like #<buffer name>, when the
point in the buffer reaches the end, the variable will return "<END>".
This makes your macros using these variables easier to write!

>>> Improved 8 bit character handling

	Many parts of the editor are much more 8 bit aware.

>>> More Completion!!

	The write-file (^X^W) and append-file (^X^A) commands now use
file name completion.

>>> Better Completion!!

	While completing file names interactively, MicroEMACS will
recognize and expand ~/ as the user's home directory, ~name/ as the
named user's home directory and $<var>/ as a directory named in an
environmental <var>. This uses the appropriate UNIX calls or looks in
the USER environment variable depending on the OS.

>>> Macros can query the Operating System

	The $os variable returns the name of the operating system which
MicroEMACS is running under.

>>> Position point within line from command line

	The -p<n> command line option positions the point within the
first line of the first file listen on the command line. This can be
used in conjunction with the -g flag to position the point anywhere
within that file.

>>> Labeling of Function Keys

	On HP terminals connected up to a UNIX system, MicroEMACS can
label the on screen function keys.

>>> Line position switch alternative

	Placing a +<n> on the command line is equivilant to -g<n>,
allowing the point to be placed on any line of the first file listed on
the command line. This makes many UNIX tools happier.

>>> Slash Handling Improved

	Forward slashes are now excepted as directory separators under
MSDOS and OS/2 as well as the native backslashes. They are translated
both on the command line and in file name completion.

>>> Control-Space decoded under UNIX

	UNIX users can now use control-<space> as a legal character.
Most DOS style machines can not scan this combination, but under UNIX
this is bound to set-mark by default.

>>> Execute-Buffer now uses buffer name completion

	When this command is called interactively, it does buffer name
completion.

>>> ISO French Header text

	As an alternative to the IBM-PC French header files, there is
also an ISO french header file for various UNIX versions. The proper
version is chosen for the appropriate operating system.

>>> Various Bug Fixes

	Many bugs found by users have been squashed.

********** Future Directions ***************

	I am continuing work on MicroEMACS, and look forward to a number
of improvements in the near to farther future. Ranked in approximate
order are:

	- Macintosh Support
	- Multiple language support for macroes
	- Parameters on macroes
	- An OS/2 Presentation Manager version
	- A possible VI user interface
	- A code compiler

********** Support *************************

	Support for MicroEMACS 3.12 is available in a couple of
different ways.  First, it is available via my bulletin board
system..... 

	The Programmer's Room
	FIDO 1:201/10
	(317) 742-5533
	24 hours  300/1200/2400/9600HST baud

	There are message areas devoted to MicroEMACS where I and other
people can answer your questions. Also there are file areas for staying
abreast of the current development version and finding and trading macro
files.
	MicroSPELL 2.1 is also available.  This version is the first
major update released in several years. These program allows you to
spell check text files and use MicroEMACS to scan the file, making
suggestions and doing various corrections.
	As before, I will continue to support these programs, and
encourage everyone to spread them around as much as they can. If you
make what you think are changes that are useful to many, send me the
updates, and as time permits, I will incorporate the ones I understand,
and agree with into the master sources.
