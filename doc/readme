	This is the official release of version 5.0 of MicroEMACS. This
file gives information on registering MicroEMACS, features which have
changed since version 4.00, notes on various installations, future
directions for MicroEMACS, contact information and bug reporting
procedures.

********** Registering MicroEMACS **********

	Keeping many environments up to date, fielding questions over
the phone, applying bug fixes and adding new features is reasonably
large task. I have been writing, maintaining and supporting MicroEMACS
since 1985. I have bought numerous computers solely to port and support
MicroEMACS on those platforms. I can not even begin to count the number
of people using MicroEMACS, and I have recieved support calls,
registrations and inquiries from many countries all over the globe. This
keeps me very busy for a hobby that I do outside my normal employment.
	If you like MicroEMACS, and want to see more work, new versions
and other shareware software to go along with it, show your support by
registering your copy. Send your registration of $25 US and I will place
you on the registration list. You will recieve information on new
releases and preferential support. If you have recieved MicroEMACS
through a software library, a CDROM collection, or a user's group, none
of those fees are passed along to the software author. Register with me
and get the latest versions, info and have a voice into future
directions.

********** Installation Notes **************

	MicroEMACS is supplied for MSDOS/OS2/WINDOWS 95/WINDOWS NT on
two 3 1/2" inch diskettes in IBMPC format. The first disk is an MSDOS,
MicroSoft Windows 95/Windows NT and OS/2 installation disk. For any of
these environments, insert the disk into your A: drive, and type:

	a:install

	The installation program will lead you through installing
MicroEMACS and all of its related files on your system's hard drive.
After installation, these are the names of the various executables:

	EMACS.EXE	MSDOS real mode version (640K limit)
	EMACS16M.EXE	MSDOS protected mode version
			(will use all memory, slightly slower than real mode)
	MEWIN.EXE	MicroSoft Windows 3.1 version
	OS2EMACS.EXE	OS/2 1.3, 2.0 or 2.1 version
	NTEMACS.EXE	Windows NT console mode version

	The second disk is a ZIP archive of all the sources, documents,
command files and makefiles. Copy this file to an empty directory on
your hard drive, and then use any unZIPper and allow it to extract this
tree of files on your hard drive. Some of the resulting files and
subdirectories will include:

AIX          makefiles for AIX (a UNIX varient)
AMIGA        makefiles for the Commodore AMIGA
ATARI        makefiles for the Atari ST
CMD          standard .CMD command files
DGEN         makefiles for the Data General
DOC          documentation files (including this!)
FREEBSD      makefiles for FREEBSD 2.0 and above
FMR          makefiles for the Fujitsu FMR series MSDOS computers
H            .H header files
HP150        makefile for the HP150 MSDOS computer
HPUX         makefile for the HP9000 workstations
I55          makefile for the IBM 5550 Katakana computer
MPE          makefile for the HP3000 series computer
MSWIN        makefiles and auxillary files for MicroSoft Windows 95
NEC          makefiles for the NEC 9800 series MSDOS machines
NT           makefiles for Windows NT
OS2          makefiles for OS/2
PCDOS        makefiles for various IBM-PC compilers and versions
POSIX        makefiles for POSIX (a UNIX varient)
SRC          .C source files
SUN4         makefiles for SUN-OS 4.1 and above (not Solaris)
VMS          makefile for DEC's VMS operating system
WINHELP      source code for the windows help files
XENIX        makefiles for XENIX
CLROBJ.BAT   MSDOS batch file to clear out all the object and executable files

	Included on this disk is a public domain MSDOS unzipping program
called "unzip" written by a group of USENET programmers. Both the actual
executable and the self unpacking package with all of its documention is
provided. Copy the diskette to the target directory, and type:

	unzip ue400dev

	to extract all the sources, command files, makefiles and
documentation to their proper directories within the that directory.

	If you need to build a version from the source files, unpack
these files, and move them and all its subdirectories to the target
machine. Change to the directory most appropriate for the machine for
which you are building MicroEMACS. Copy from the H subdirectory the file
ESTRUCT.H to this directory. Edit ESTRUCT.H, changing the definition
from zero to one for the appropriate hardware, compiler, terminal
driver. Edit any other parameters or options as appropriate. You may
need to create an OBJ and a BIN subdirectory from this directory. Then
run your make utility to compile and link a MicroEMACS executable.

	Under MicroSoft Windows, or Windows NT, use the NEW option of the
FILES menu of the file program manager to add a program item. Set the
program executable to the drive where you installed MicroEMACS,
remembering the name of the Windows executable is mewin.exe. The
MicroEMACS icon will appear in the program window you have currently
open.

	Under Windows 95, or the newer versions of Windows NT (Version
5.0 and above), press the START button, select SETTINGS and then select
TASKBAR. Once within this dialog, use it to add an entry in your program
menu to execute the MicroEMACS executable file. Windows 95 will handle
all the needed memory settings.

	Under OS/2, copy a program template to the desktop, and then use
its settings menu to set the path to the program executable and the
correct working directory. The name of the OS/2 executable is
OS2EMACS.EXE. The icon for MicroEMACS should replace the template icon.
Drag this to where you want it to be placed.

	Under the differing varieties of UNIX, if you are installing
MicroEMACS systemwide, you need to place it and all of its command files
into a directory that all your users can access. Rename the emacs.rc
startup file to .emacsrc. Once your users have this directory in their
path, they will be able to use MicroEMACS. They can create a local
.emacsrc file that will overide the code in the system MicroEMACS
startup file. Be carefull to allow read permissions on all the
MicroEMACS files.

	On the Atari ST, be sure that MicroEMACS is installed as a GEM
application from the GEM desktop.  If this is not done, MicroEMACS will
grow confused about the state of the mouse, and ring the bell alot to
alert the user to the problem.  (Mouse handling on the Atari is both
complex and triple layered....).

********** Edit history since the First 4.00 BETA release

	The Windows help file and the TEXT online documents have been

If you need to report any bugs, you should be sure to include the this
information:

- Contact info of the reporter

- Hardware where the bug manifests itself

- Operating System and OS version number

- a list of the ESTRUCT.H switches used to compile effected version
	or file name of distributed .exe

- compiler and makefile used to compile MicroEMACS

- a clear, step by step method to reproduce the problem
  any pertinate macro code or text files used

- Under MSDOS:
	- a list of any concurrent software (TSRs, etc)
	- a copy of the autoexec.bat and config.sys files

********** Support *************************

	Support for MicroEMACS 5.0 is available in a couple of
different ways.  First, it is available via my unix system..... 

	AQUEST.COM
	24 hours  300/1200/2400/9600HST/14400 baud

	user: uemacs
	password: support

	There will be message areas devoted to MicroEMACS where I and
other people can answer your questions. Also there are file areas for
staying abreast of the current development version and finding and
trading macro files.

	MicroSPELL 2.1 is also available.  This version is the first
major update released in several years. These program allows you to
spell check text files and use MicroEMACS to scan the file, making
suggestions and doing various corrections.

	As before, I will continue to support these programs, and
encourage everyone to spread them around as much as they can. If you
make what you think are changes that are useful to many, send me the
updates, and as time permits, I will incorporate the ones I understand,
and agree with into the master sources.
