<P>MicroEMACS is normally in what many other editors consider "insert" mode. This means when you strike a character, MicroEMACS makes room for that character in the current line, inserting it between the existing characters. In REP mode, MicroEMACS instead replaces the existing character under the <A HREF="glos7kdw.htm">point</A> with the character you type. REP mode will not maintain the position of text which takes up multiple columns using tabs since it will replace a single tab character with the typed character which will not take up the same space on screen. For this purpose, the <A HREF="help465u.htm">OVER mode</A> is more appropriate</P>

<P>However, Japanese KANJI characters will correctly replace and be replaced in this mode as the two bytes will be considered together when either style character is used.</P>
