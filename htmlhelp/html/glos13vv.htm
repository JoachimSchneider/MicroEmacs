<P><A NAME="mark"></A>The <B>mark </B>is the position in the current buffer which delimits the beginning or the end of a region. Various commands operate on text from the mark to the point, or move the current point to the mark. The mark can be set by the set-mark command.</P>

<P>Each buffer contains 16 independent marks, numbered 0 to 15. Most region-related commands, however, only refer to mark 0.</P>

<P>Marks 10 to 15 are reserved for use by macros. Marks 0 to 9 are reserved for interactive use.</P>

<P>Marks 11 and 12 are used internally by MicroEMACS by the mouse-region-down and mouse-region-up commands.</P>
