<P>Default binding: <A HREF="glos3hgu.htm">MSa</A> (Press on left mouse button)</P>

<P>This <A HREF="macr9ylv.htm">command</A> is meant to be associated with a mouse action. It depends on the <A HREF="macr5nhv.htm">$xpos</A> and <A HREF="macr19rn.htm">$ypos</A> <A HREF="glos7v51.htm">variables</A> to contain the coordinates of the mouse pointer. It makes the <A HREF="glos0wxa.htm">screen</A> and <A HREF="glos1zg7.htm">window</A> where the mouse was clicked the current ones. If the mouse pointer is within the text part of a window (as opposed to the <A HREF="glos0bxh.htm">mode line</A>) the point is placed at that position in the text (or at the end of the line if the mouse pointer lies beyond the end of a line).</P>

<P>This command is unaffected by <A HREF="glos9jec.htm">numeric arguments</A>.</P>

<P>Note:Under the MS-Windows version of MicroEMACS, the selection of the current screen is performed by the press on the left mouse button, regardless of the button's binding. Mouse commands themselves cannot select the current screen.</P>
