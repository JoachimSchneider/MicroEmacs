<H1><A NAME="memoryusage"></A>Memory Usage</H1>

<P>The only limit to the number of <A HREF="glos81bm.htm">buffers</A> is the memory of your computer. All the buffers, text, <A HREF="glos0wxa.htm">screens</A> and <A HREF="glos1zg7.htm">windows</A> use memory for storage.</P>

<P>Under Microsoft Windows, the accessible storage can be rather large, depending on the amount of extended memory installed on you system. If you are running in Windows 3.x 386-enhanced mode, MicroEMACS is able to use virtual memory, allowing you to edit very large files.</P>

<P>Under MSDOS, the AMIGA, the Atari ST, the HP150 and other microcomputers you can estimate the memory used by adding up the size of all the files you want to edit simultaneously, multiply by 1.4, and add 170K for the size of MicroEMACS. This results in the amount of free memory needed to edit these files. On an MSDOS machine with 574K of conventional memory available, you can edit files totaling about 288K in size. If you are using the DOS-extended version of MicroEMACS, the memory available for editing is determined by the amount of extended memory installed in your computer, up to 16 Megabytes.</P>

<P>On UNIX, Windows NT and other systems with large virtual memory there is almost no limit to the number and size of files you edit.</P>
