<P><A NAME="killbuffer"></A>The <B>kill buffer</B> accumulates any text which is "killed" by a number of delete commands. If more than one delete command is used in a row, all the text from all the commands will be in the kill buffer. Using any command between deletes causes the kill buffer to just hold the most recent deletions.</P>

<P>Using this feature and the yank command, you can switch between windows, screens and files and copy text from one file to another.There is no limit to the amount of text that can be stored in the kill buffer except that of the memory of the computer running MicroEMACS. Extremely large kills may take a few seconds.</P>

<P>The last 16 kill buffers are kept in the kill ring. You can retrieve their contents through the cycle-ring or the yank-pop commands.</P>
