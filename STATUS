Workarounds for cores produced by wrong settings of Dot-Ofsset (w_doto, b_doto)
outside of the current line.


Reproducing the error:

(1) Fill Paragraph (Esc-q)

(2) Undo (Ctrl+Shift+_)

This confuses the doto settings: Microemacs always assumes 0 <= doto <= l_used.

With -DJES_UNSEC_CODE the errors could be reproduced.

Furthermore fill-paragraph does not work correctly e.g. when used in som TeX-documents.


[2021-10-05.00]

Next steps to repair the (w|b)_doto-Problem:

(1) Introduce (get|set)_(b|w)_doto Makros and use the througout the code: Done.
(2) Test uemacs with this modification.
(3) Fix wrong (w|b)_doto-Settings in the (get|set)_(b|w)_doto Macros and trace wrong settings.
(4) Check that TRC in line.c isn't triggered any more.
(5) Remove Fix and TRC in line.c.
(6) Try to go from TRC to ASRT to fix the error.
(7) Enable the other platforms.
