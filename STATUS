# SOF

Workarounds for cores produced by wrong settings of Dot-Ofsset (w_doto, b_doto)
outside of the current line.


Reproducing the error:

(1) Fill Paragraph (Esc-q)

(2) Undo (Ctrl+Shift+_)

This confuses the doto settings: Microemacs always assumes 0 <= doto <= l_used.

With -DJES_UNSEC_CODE the errors could be reproduced.

Furthermore fill-paragraph does not work correctly e.g. when used in som TeX-documents.
