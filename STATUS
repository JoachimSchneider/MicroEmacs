Workarounds for cores produced by wrong settings of Dot-Ofsset (w_doto, b_doto)
outside of the current line.


Reproducing the error:

(1) Fill Paragraph (Esc-q)

(2) Undo (Ctrl+Shift+_)

This confuses the doto settings: Microemacs always assumes 0 <= doto <= l_used.

With -DJES_UNSEC_CODE the errors could be reproduced.

Furthermore fill-paragraph does not work correctly e.g. when used in som TeX-documents.

Next steps to repair the (w|b)_doto-Problem:

(1) Introduce (get|set)_(b|w)_doto Makros and use the througout the code: Done.
(2) Test uemacs with this modification: Done.
(3) Fix wrong (w|b)_doto-Settings in the (get|set)_(b|w)_doto Macros and trace wrong settings: Done.
(4) Check that TRC in line.c isn't triggered any more: Done.
(5) Remove Fix and TRC in line.c: Done.

(6) FIX THIS ERROR: `TRC (../src/undo.c/131): set_w_doto(): Too large doto: 156. REWRITTEN TO: 155.'
(7) Enable the other platforms. 
(8) Introduce get/set-Logic and repair-code of the dot-code for the mark code as well.
