MicroEMACS for DJGPP
=====================

* One may compile it with DJDEV203 (the Readme.1st and
  manifest/djdev###.ver in the DJGPP root directory amd give you the
  DJGPP version) which is from June 2002.
  - This version works in principle, but
  - The extended keyboard keys (FN-keys, Arrow-Keys etc.) *don't*
    work, so
  - You *may* work with MicroEMACS because it does not need these keys.
  Use the `scancode' program from the tools directory to check the
  codes generated by specific keys.

* It works without this restriction if you use DJDEV204 (2003?) or ---
  better --- DJDEV205 (2015) for compilation as their runtimes have
  reworked terminal handling.

* To run you need a DPMI server:
  - e.g. cwsdpmi if you run it in plain DOS or in DOSBox
  - The Linux DOSEMU supports DPMI.
  - Or run it in Windows 2000 or Windows XP which have a built-in DPMI
    server.

* It uses ANSI Escape Sequences for terminal control. Therefore in
  plain DOS (and Linux DOSEMU) you need to activate ANSI.SYS.

* If you get `Load error: no DPMI memory' when gcc ist started by make
  you may check the available DPMI by typing `go32-v2'. Increase it, as
  newer gcc compilers need much more then 20MB.

* If you get warnings (from newer gcc versions) about unused local
  typedefs in CASRT add `-Wno-unused-local-typedefs' by uncommenting
  the appropriate WARNFLAGS in the makefile.

* Testet on MS-DOS 6.22 (in Linux DOSEMU), DOSBox, Microsoft Windows
  2000 and Windows XP:

  On Windows it has these additional Features:
  - Long File Name support
  - MicroEMACS uses the Windows shell (cmd.exe) rather than the DOS
    shell (command.com) to execute external commands.

The emacs.rc file inludes definitions for function keys and other
special keys. You may look up the strings generated by a specific key
with the help of the scancode program with C source in the tools
subdirectory.
