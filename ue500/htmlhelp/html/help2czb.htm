<P>When in VIEW mode, no <A HREF="glos3a3o.htm">command</A> which would change the text is allowed. If you attempt any such command, or try to type in any text, MicroEMACS responds with:</P>

<P>[Key Illegal in View Mode]</P>

<P>This mode is very useful when you want to just look at some existing text, as it will prevent you from changing that text. Also MicroEMACS will not attempt a <A HREF="glos8wo7.htm">file lock</A> if a file is read in VIEW mode, allowing you to view files which you don't have write access to, or other people have locked. To launch MicroEMACS and read a file in VIEW mode, use the -v <A HREF="help46cz.htm">switch</A>:</P>

<P>emacs -v <I>filename</I></P>
