<P>Regions are used in MicroEMACS to specify what text is acted on by many <A HREF="glos3a3o.htm">commands</A>. A region is defined as all the text between the <A HREF="glos7kdw.htm">point</A>, and the last placed <A HREF="glos13vv.htm">mark</A>. To define a region:</P>

<P>1.Move the point to the beginning of the text you want to effect</P>

<P>2.Use the <A HREF="comm48yz.htm">set-mark</A> (<A HREF="glos3icl.htm">M- </A>) command to position the mark at the current point</P>

<P>3.Move the point to the end of the text you want to affect</P>

<P>At this time, the text between the mark and the point is the current region which will be affected by many commands. Regions can be defined backwards as well as forwards, and can include the entire <A HREF="glos81bm.htm">buffer</A>, or as little as one character.</P>
