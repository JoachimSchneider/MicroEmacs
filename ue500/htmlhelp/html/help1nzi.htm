<P>MicroEMACS is a tool for creating and changing documents, programs, and other text files. It is both relatively easy for the novice to use, but also very powerful in the hands of an expert. MicroEMACS can be extensively customized for the needs of the individual user.</P>

<P>MicroEMACS allows several files to be edited at the same time. The display can be split into different <A HREF="glos1zg7.htm">windows</A> and <A HREF="glos0wxa.htm">screens</A>, and text may be moved freely from one window on any screen to the next. Depending on the type of file being edited, MicroEMACS can change how it behaves to make editing simple. Editing standard text files, program files and word processing documents are all possible at the same time.</P>

<P>There are extensive capabilities to make word processing and editing easier. These include commands for string searching and replacing, paragraph reformatting and deleting, automatic word wrapping, word move and deletes, easy case controlling, and automatic word counts.</P>

<P>For complex and repetitive editing tasks editing <A HREF="glos9lnz.htm">macros</A> can be written. These macros allow the user a great degree of flexibility in determining how MicroEMACS behaves. Also, any and all the <A HREF="glos3a3o.htm">commands</A> can be used by any keystroke by changing, or <A HREF="glos21rb.htm">rebinding</A>, what commands various keys invoke.</P>

<P>Special features are also available to perform a diverse set of operations such as file encryption, automatic backup file generation, entabbing and detabbing lines, executing operating system commands and filtering of text through other programs (like SORT to allow sorting text).</P>
