<P>EMACS was originally a text editor written by Richard Stallman at MIT in the early 1970s for Digital Equipment computers. Various versions, rewrites and clones have made an appearance since.</P>

<P>This version of MicroEMACS is derived from code written by David G. Conroy in 1985. Later modifications were performed by Steve Wilhite and George Jones. In December of 1985 <A HREF="help0x0l.htm">Daniel Lawrence</A> picked up the then current source (version 2.0) and made extensive modifications and additions to it over the course of the next six years.</P>

<P>In November 1990, <A HREF="help2v90.htm">Pierre Perret</A> produced a port of MicroEMACS 3.10e to the Microsoft Windows 3.0 environment (BETA version 0.6a which never enjoyed a full release). The first public version, 1.0, based on MicroEMACS 3.11c, was released in April 1992.</P>

<P>Update 1.1 included bug fixes, port to Windows NT, support of scroll bars and drag and drop mechanism. It was the first release to include a complete help file.</P>

<P>The new version 4.0 of MicroEMACS incorporates the port of the editor to MS-Windows, adding many new features, among which the capabilities to highlight selected regions of  text, and to undo arbitrary editing changes.</P>
