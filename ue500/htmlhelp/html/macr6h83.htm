<H2><A NAME="buffervariables"></A>Buffer Variables</H2>

<P>Buffer <A HREF="macr3d0z.htm">variables</A> are a way to take a line of text from a buffer and place it in a variable. They can only be queried and cannot be set. A buffer variable consists of the buffer name, preceded by a pound sign "#". Its value is the text between the point and the end of the line. Each use of a buffer variable advances the point to the beginning of the following line.</P>

<P>For example, if you have a buffer by the name of RIGEL2, and it contains the text (the point being on the "B" of "Bloomington"): </P>

<P>Richmond</P>

<P>Lafayette</P>

<P><B>B</B>loomington</P>

<P>Indianapolis</P>

<P>Gary</P>

<P>and within a command you reference #rigel2, like in:</P>

<P>insert-string #rigel2</P>

<P>MicroEMACS would start at the current point in the RIGEL2 buffer and grab all the text up to the end of that line and pass that back. Then it would advance the point to the beginning of the next line. Thus, after the insert-string command executes, the string "Bloomington" gets inserted into the current buffer, and the buffer RIGEL2 now looks like this (the point is on the "I" of "Indianapolis"):</P>

<P>Richmond</P>

<P>Lafayette</P>

<P>Bloomington</P>

<P><B>I</B>ndianapolis</P>

<P>Gary</P>

<P>When the end of a buffer variable is reached, the value returned is: &lt;END&gt;</P>
